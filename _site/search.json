But being a very open community, there are also dozens of user groups who attend these conferences - from pharma and life sciences researchers, to business operations, to the insurance industry. It’s a uniquely and fantastically wide world of expertise at these things. So I did my best to identify a single train of thought that could be presented in the 20-minute window.\nThe Posit team liked it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey invited me for a 20-minute talk. And that talk turned into Why Design Is Worth The Time: Leveraging cognitive science to amplify impact. As a compliment to the many conference sessions that gave great ways how to make deliverables beautiful and cohesive, I wanted to provide some scientific backing for why it is worth the time it takes.\n\n\nShockingly, 20 minutes is not enough time to condense 15+ years of obsession with how the human brain processes information. I used my 20 minutes to hit the highlights of cognitive science in very superficial detail, provide my practical recommendations about based in that science, and then provide citations and links for people to dig in further.\nTurns out lots of people liked it."

And I’ve had dozens of follow-up questions from people from chatting at the conference, or via email/LinkedIn.\nSo that brings us here: to a blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI plan on using this space as a place to expand on the topics of intersection of design, cognitive science in information processing, data storytelling, and information communication.\nHopefully, I’ll be presenting again at Posit::conf(2024), however Posit is notoriously good at big swings at inclusivity and rarely accept talks from the same person two years in a row. So at a minimum, you’ll see me as an attendee in Seattle in 2024. In the meantime, I’ll be here.\n\n\nBonus notes\n\nThe conferences are styled Posit::conf(2023) because its a jokey nod to the way we write code in the R language, and nerds are nothing if not excited to make corny jokes whenever possible. (Not just limited to R, go ask the python folks why the name of their language is python.)\nIf you want to be social with me (these are by no means my “professional” socials, but I have fun anyway), I’m active on Instagram and on Threads.\n  - @laura_brianna"

Sure, “data is the new oil” 1 - both data and raw petroleum need a lot of refinement to be made useful and profitable. But unlike oil, data requires more than mere processing; It requires context, analysis, and interpretation. This is where design comes in to play.\nA “pretty” data visualization or “clean” looking text block or table may be more than visually appealing. Information design is not merely an art; it’s a science grounded in cognitive psychology, attention theory, and decision-making research."

    "section": "Cognitive Load and Data Visualization",
    "text": "Cognitive Load and Data Visualization\nThe concept of cognitive load theory, first popularized by John Sweller in the late 1980s, serves as a critical framework for understanding how human cognition works during learning processes 2. In its most simplified form, cognitive load theory posits that human working memory is limited, and that effective learning and decision-making are constrained by the amount of information we can process simultaneously. This is why its so hard to cram for an exam - you can only absorb so much at one time.\nCognitive load theory is broken apart into three components 3:\n\nIntrinsic Cognitive Load: this is the inherent complexity associated with the material being learned or presented, and is related to the subject matter itself. The intrinsic load of a specific topic is generally unchangeable - it is easier to learn addition than it is to learn how to calculate differential equations.\nExtraneous Cognitive Load: this is the additional cognitive load imposed by the way information is structured, presented, or the learning environment itself. It represents the unnecessary mental effort required to process information that is not directly relevant to the subject matter. While most people think of this as data visualization, it can also be the structure of a report, the scaffolding of a table, or the readability of a font selection. Your job as a presenter or teacher is to lessen the extraneous load as much as possible so you can maximize the impact of other two load types.\nGermane Cognitive Load: This is the mental effort applied to learning the task itself, or the specific brain power used to organize information in the head, anchor it to existing and relevant existing schema, or create new schema and mental models. This is where a concept is integrated into long-term memory and made available for recall later.\n\n\nAs Simple as Possible (but No Simpler)\nIn data visualization and information design, this principle is critical: overload your audience with too much information, complex visual structures, or intricate details, and you risk diluting the message you aim to convey. For instance, a visualization filled with unnecessary decorations, often called “chartjunk,” can increase extraneous cognitive load, and may lead to a less effective presentation of data 4. This is the classic ‘Edward Tufte’ view of data visualization that you tend to hear in many data visualization courses 5. You may also have heard about this as an ‘information to ink’ ratio, or something similar.\n\n\n\nAn example of Chartjunk, from https://www.edwardtufte.com\n\n\nOn the other hand, an overly simplistic visualization might not adequately represent the complexities of the data, thus under-utilizing the available cognitive resources and possibly leading to overly simplistic conclusions. You also may be accused of ‘hiding important information’ and lose some of your audience’s trust.\n\n\nUnless You’re Like, Really Good\nIf that weren’t complicated enough, enter: The Infographic. Infographics tend to lean harder into the art side and/or journalism side of things.\nOn the journalism side, you have probably seen some gorgeous visualizations from brilliant and creative people like Alberto Cairo or Mona Chalabi. You can also explore the Tidy Tuesday creations from people like Cedric Scherer, who thread the needle between art, science, and communication in clever ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {style=” display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;“} ::: {style=”background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;“}\n\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;“}\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;“}\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {style=” color:#3897f0; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:550; line-height:18px;“} View this post on Instagram\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;“}\n\n::: {style=” width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg)“}\n\n:::\n\n::: {style=” width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);“}\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);“}\n:::\n::: {style=” width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);“}\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;“}\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;“}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA post shared by Alberto Cairo (@alberto.cairo.howchartslie)\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {style=” display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;“} ::: {style=”background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;“}\n\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;“}\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;“}\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {style=” color:#3897f0; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:550; line-height:18px;“} View this post on Instagram\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;“}\n\n::: {style=” width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg)“}\n\n:::\n\n::: {style=” width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);“}\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);“}\n:::\n::: {style=” width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);“}\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;“}\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;“}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA post shared by Mona Chalabi (@monachalabi)\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThese visuals don’t 100% firmly obey the “Classic Tufte Method”. But also no one can say these visuals do not draw you in, teach you something, and leave you with something interesting to chew on for a while. They are incredibly effective. If you look hard enough, the core ideas are rooted firmly in the foundations; the cleverest people know exactly how to break which rules and when.\n\n\nBalancing Art and Science\n\n\nEffective visualizations strike a balance; they are rich enough to convey the necessary complexity of the data while being simple enough to be quickly and easily understood. If they incorporate artistic flourishes, those serve to draw you in and keep you there, and are put in with surgical precision to stay out of the way of the information itself.\nThe best communicators use several different encoding mechanisms - balancing extrinsic load across systems that process color, text, pattern, movement, and more - to deliver more information in a more digestible way. This sweet spot makes the most efficient use of our cognitive resources, ensuring that the message gets through clearly and memorably without unnecessary mental strain.\nThe concept of cognitive load serves as both a guide and a warning: it helps designers create more effective visualizations, but it’s also a reminder that optimizing for one audience might not work for another.\nWhich leads us to our next point.\n\n\n\n\n\nBalancing science and art to cleanly convey a complex message.

    "section": "The Importance of Context (& Emotion)",
    "text": "The Importance of Context (& Emotion)\nBack to the classic business context, data visualization is not just about displaying data points, but also about setting them within the right context.\n\nFraming Effects and Attention\nContext is crucial in data visualization because the way information is framed can dramatically influence how it is received and understood. Kahneman and Tversky’s seminal work on prospect theory reveals that the same information, when presented differently, can lead to divergent decisions and perceptions 6. This cognitive bias, known as the framing effect, manifests itself in various domains, including public health, finance, and social policy.\nOnce you start looking, you see these framing effects are everywhere.\n\nA new drug that can cure 70% of patients. Framing this information as “30% of patients will not be cured” could discourage its usage compared to saying “70% will be cured.”\nA graph showcasing increasing CO2 levels over the last decade is likely to be ignored. However, if paired with a timeline of natural disasters in the same period, the same data could evoke a more urgent response.\nElection maps are typically colored by area to show which candidate won which region, which doesn’t align at all with population density. There is a big difference in showing a geographic area versus showing a cartogram (where the size of each region is adjusted based on population).\n\n\n\nEmotional Impact and Ethical Considerations\nEmotion serves as another pivotal axis around which data visualization revolves. Emotion can both enhance and skew the interpretation of data. For example, vivid, fear-inducing colors in a heat map could elicit a stronger response compared to softer, less alarming colors. Simply making a number on a report bold and red will evoke a more emotional tone than the exact same number in black text. Color has a demonstrable impact on psychological functioning. Misleading color choices not only violate ethical standards but also can trigger unintended emotional responses 7.\nThe use of emotion in data visualization raises several ethical considerations.\nEmotion can be a powerful tool to break down barriers of apathy or desensitization. Think of the images and infographics that went viral during significant social movements or disasters. Their emotional resonance often led to higher engagement and subsequent action.\nEmotionally charged visualizations must also consider the risk of reinforcing stereotypes or biases. An ill-designed graphic could inadvertently stigmatize communities, leading to adverse societal implications. Thus, ethical guidelines such as “fairness” and “do no harm,” which are cornerstones of responsible journalism and scientific reporting, extend their applicability to the domain of data visualization. Emphasizing the need for transparent scales, accurate data representation, and avoiding deceptive visual elements ensure the graph is both “pretty” and ethical.8\nTo navigate this intricate landscape, understanding the nuances of both framing and emotional elements can be instrumental. By doing so, one can leverage the power of visualization to inform and persuade, while maintaining ethical integrity."

    "section": "Those Who Tell the Stories Rule the World",
    "text": "Those Who Tell the Stories Rule the World\n\nNarrative and Memory\nHumans are storytellers by default and have been for at least 30,000 years 9. It’s how we communicate best. We are simply wired to remember stories better than lists of facts, and this insight can be instrumental in the realm of data communication. Jerome Bruner, a cognitive psychologist, posited that narratives up to 22 times more memorable than facts alone (Bruner, 1991). This underscores the importance of incorporating story elements not just into reports and presentations, but to weave it into your data visualizations as well.\nThe reason storytelling is so effective lies in its structure. Most narratives have a beginning, middle, and end, allowing the audience to follow along a ‘path’ which organically leads to the key message or conclusion.\nPresentations tend to start with a ‘where we were’, to a ‘what we did’ to a ‘what’s next’ section. Scientific articles tend start with an introduction, move to materials and methods, into a discussion and conclusion, and then suggest further research. Your tables and data visualizations tend to have an informative title on the top left, and progress to the smaller details in captions on the bottom right (in reading order across a page).\nThis temporal progression helps the audience to grasp the urgency and also the possible ramifications, allowing the data to be contextualized and thus, better remembered.\n\n\nChoose Your Own Adventure: The Role of Interactivity\nInteractivity is another dimension that can elevate your data communication strategies. Interactivity enables the viewer to explore the data by themselves, enhancing their understanding and retention of the information presented. A study by Yi, et al. demonstrated that interactivity significantly improved viewers’ ability to acquire insights from visualizations 10.\nIn today’s digital age, the opportunity for making data visualizations interactive is more accessible than ever, through tools and platforms that allow zooming, filtering, or even real-time updates. For example, instead of just showing a static map of volunteer and donation rates for your non-rofit, an interactive map could allow users to zoom into their local area or filter by various demographic factors. This not only keeps the viewer’s attention but also makes the information more relevant to them.\nMoreover, interactivity can serve to guide the viewer through complex datasets, in a manner somewhat akin to an interactive narrative. By allowing viewers to ‘unearth’ facts and trends themselves, you engage them in a form of ‘active learning,’ which is shown to be more effective for retention and understanding 11.\nBoth narrative storytelling and interactive elements can captivate the viewer’s attention, which is an increasingly scarce commodity in our information-saturated world. Used judiciously, these techniques can turn a dull report into a compelling story, and a static chart into an exploration, ensuring that your important data isn’t just seen, but also understood and remembered."

    "text": "Conclusions\nEffective data visualization is not merely a matter of aesthetics. It is a multifaceted discipline deeply rooted in cognitive science, psychology, and ethical considerations. The true beauty of a “pretty” data visualization lies in its ability to efficiently communicate complex information, provide context, evoke the right emotions, narrate a compelling story, and engage the audience interactively—all of which is backed by rigorous scholarly research. The aim is not just to make data visually appealing, but to transform it into a strategic asset for decision-making.\nSo, the next time you look at a data visualization and think it’s ‘pretty,’ ask yourself why. Is it just visually appealing, or does is the sum of it somehow greater than all of its parts? Chances are, if it’s genuinely effective, it’s much more than just a pretty picture."

    "text": "A Bit About the Author\nTechnically an Epidemiologist, Dr. Gast has spent her career at the intersection of communicating technical work to non-technical (and often extremely busy) decision makers.\nShe spent several years working primarily in Southern Africa developing malaria elimination strategies and operational reporting frameworks. It was during these years where she honed her skills for communicating something highly specific and technical in as little of time as humanly possible; sometimes you only have one data viz, one slide or one sentence to convince a powerful decision-maker that your idea is worth investing in. Dr. Gast has worked on infectious and communicable disease projects in at least 10 countries.\nBack in her didactic education days, she somehow managed to convince NASA to fund her Public Health doctoral dissertation. She spent several years wandering the jungles of Peru in order to figure out ways to use satellite imagery and machine learning to classify land-use land-cover changes and how it relates to mosquito-borne diseases like dengue hemorrhagic fever. Despite sleeping in a house without real doors where 3 people got dengue (and it was a 50/50 shot of waking up with 2 inches of water across the entire homestead and a mouse trying to climb the dresser to get away from the flood), she managed to complete her field work without getting dengue herself.\nThese days, you will find Dr. Gast living a calmer life, working for a non-profit dedicated to serving US military members and their families, wrestling with development and impact data.\nIn her ever-shrinking free time, you’ll find Laura playing pub trivia, throwing some darts, attending live performances (comedy, rock, symphony, etc), or training up to run several marathons (where the hard work feels good after a several-years-long recovery from a back injury)."
