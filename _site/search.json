    "text": "‘Pretty’ Means More than Just ‘Pretty’\nIn a data-driven world, the ability to effectively communicate complex information is invaluable. Sure, “data is the new oil” 1 - both data and raw petroleum need a lot of refinement to be made useful and profitable. But unlike oil, data requires more than mere processing; It requires context, analysis, and interpretation. This is where design comes in to play.\nA “pretty” data visualization or “clean” looking text block or table may be more than visually appealing. Information design is not merely an art; it’s a science grounded in cognitive psychology, attention theory, and decision-making research."

    "section": "Cognitive Load and Data Visualization",
    "text": "Cognitive Load and Data Visualization\n\n\nThe concept of cognitive load theory, first popularized by John Sweller in the late 1980s, serves as a critical framework for understanding how human cognition works during learning processes 2. In its most simplified form, cognitive load theory posits that human working memory is limited, and that effective learning and decision-making are constrained by the amount of information we can process simultaneously. This is why its so hard to cram for an exam - you can only absorb so much at one time.\n\n\n\n\n\nCognitive load theory is broken apart into three components 3:\n\nIntrinsic Cognitive Load: this is the inherent complexity associated with the material being learned or presented, and is related to the subject matter itself. The intrinsic load of a specific topic is generally unchangeable - it is easier to learn addition than it is to learn how to calculate differential equations.\nExtraneous Cognitive Load: this is the additional cognitive load imposed by the way information is structured, presented, or the learning environment itself. It represents the unnecessary mental effort required to process information that is not directly relevant to the subject matter. While most people think of this as data visualization, it can also be the structure of a report, the scaffolding of a table, or the readability of a font selection. Your job as a presenter or teacher is to lessen the extraneous load as much as possible so you can maximize the impact of other two load types.\nGermane Cognitive Load: This is the mental effort applied to learning the task itself, or the specific brain power used to organize information in the head, anchor it to existing and relevant existing schema, or create new schema and mental models. This is where a concept is integrated into long-term memory and made available for recall later.\n\n\nAs Simple as Possible (but No Simpler)\nIn data visualization and information design, this principle is critical: overload your audience with too much information, complex visual structures, or intricate details, and you risk diluting the message you aim to convey. For instance, a visualization filled with unnecessary decorations, often called “chartjunk,” can increase extraneous cognitive load, and may lead to a less effective presentation of data 4. This is the classic ‘Edward Tufte’ view of data visualization that you tend to hear in many data visualization courses 5. You may also have heard about this as an ‘information to ink’ ratio, or something similar.\n\n\n\nAn example of Chartjunk, from https://www.edwardtufte.com\n\n\nOn the other hand, an overly simplistic visualization might not adequately represent the complexities of the data, thus under-utilizing the available cognitive resources and possibly leading to overly simplistic conclusions. You also may be accused of ‘hiding important information’ and lose some of your audience’s trust.\n\n\nUnless You’re Like, Really Good\nIf that weren’t complicated enough, enter: The Infographic. Infographics tend to lean harder into the art side and/or journalism side of things.\nOn the journalism side, you have probably seen some gorgeous visualizations from brilliant and creative people like Alberto Cairo or Mona Chalabi. You can also explore the Tidy Tuesday creations from people like Cedric Scherer, who thread the needle between art, science, and communication in clever ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {style=” display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;“} ::: {style=”background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;“}\n\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;“}\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;“}\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {style=” color:#3897f0; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:550; line-height:18px;“} View this post on Instagram\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;“}\n\n::: {style=” width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg)“}\n\n:::\n\n::: {style=” width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);“}\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);“}\n:::\n::: {style=” width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);“}\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;“}\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;“}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA post shared by Alberto Cairo (@alberto.cairo.howchartslie)\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {style=” display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;“} ::: {style=”background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;“}\n\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;“}\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;“}\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {style=” color:#3897f0; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:550; line-height:18px;“} View this post on Instagram\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;“}\n\n::: {style=” width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg)“}\n\n:::\n\n::: {style=” width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);“}\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);“}\n:::\n::: {style=” width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);“}\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;“}\n\n::: {style=” background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;“}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA post shared by Mona Chalabi (@monachalabi)\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThese visuals don’t 100% firmly obey the “Classic Tufte Method”. But also no one can say these visuals do not draw you in, teach you something, and leave you with something interesting to chew on for a while. They are incredibly effective. If you look hard enough, the core ideas are rooted firmly in the foundations; the cleverest people know exactly how to break which rules and when.\n\n\nBalancing Art and Science\n\n\nEffective visualizations strike a balance; they are rich enough to convey the necessary complexity of the data while being simple enough to be quickly and easily understood. If they incorporate artistic flourishes, those serve to draw you in and keep you there, and are put in with surgical precision to stay out of the way of the information itself.\nThe best communicators use several different encoding mechanisms - balancing extrinsic load across systems that process color, text, pattern, movement, and more - to deliver more information in a more digestible way. This sweet spot makes the most efficient use of our cognitive resources, ensuring that the message gets through clearly and memorably without unnecessary mental strain.\nThe concept of cognitive load serves as both a guide and a warning: it helps designers create more effective visualizations, but it’s also a reminder that optimizing for one audience might not work for another.\nWhich leads us to our next point.\n\n\n\n\n\nBalancing science and art to cleanly convey a complex message.

    "section": "The Importance of Context (& Emotion)",
    "text": "The Importance of Context (& Emotion)\nBack to the classic business context, data visualization is not just about displaying data points, but also about setting them within the right context.\n\nFraming Effects and Attention\nContext is crucial in data visualization because the way information is framed can dramatically influence how it is received and understood. Kahneman and Tversky’s seminal work on prospect theory reveals that the same information, when presented differently, can lead to divergent decisions and perceptions 6. This cognitive bias, known as the framing effect, manifests itself in various domains, including public health, finance, and social policy.\nOnce you start looking, you see these framing effects are everywhere.\n\nA new drug that can cure 70% of patients. Framing this information as “30% of patients will not be cured” could discourage its usage compared to saying “70% will be cured.”\nA graph showcasing increasing CO2 levels over the last decade is likely to be ignored. However, if paired with a timeline of natural disasters in the same period, the same data could evoke a more urgent response.\nElection maps are typically colored by area to show which candidate won which region, which doesn’t align at all with population density. There is a big difference in showing a geographic area versus showing a cartogram (where the size of each region is adjusted based on population).\n\n\n\nEmotional Impact and Ethical Considerations\nEmotion serves as another pivotal axis around which data visualization revolves. Emotion can both enhance and skew the interpretation of data. For example, vivid, fear-inducing colors in a heat map could elicit a stronger response compared to softer, less alarming colors. Simply making a number on a report bold and red will evoke a more emotional tone than the exact same number in black text. Color has a demonstrable impact on psychological functioning. Misleading color choices not only violate ethical standards but also can trigger unintended emotional responses 7.\nThe use of emotion in data visualization raises several ethical considerations.\nEmotion can be a powerful tool to break down barriers of apathy or desensitization. Think of the images and infographics that went viral during significant social movements or disasters. Their emotional resonance often led to higher engagement and subsequent action.\nEmotionally charged visualizations must also consider the risk of reinforcing stereotypes or biases. An ill-designed graphic could inadvertently stigmatize communities, leading to adverse societal implications. Thus, ethical guidelines such as “fairness” and “do no harm,” which are cornerstones of responsible journalism and scientific reporting, extend their applicability to the domain of data visualization. Emphasizing the need for transparent scales, accurate data representation, and avoiding deceptive visual elements ensure the graph is both “pretty” and ethical.8\nTo navigate this intricate landscape, understanding the nuances of both framing and emotional elements can be instrumental. By doing so, one can leverage the power of visualization to inform and persuade, while maintaining ethical integrity."

    "section": "Those Who Tell the Stories Rule the World",
    "text": "Those Who Tell the Stories Rule the World\n\nNarrative and Memory\nHumans are storytellers by default and have been for at least 30,000 years 9. It’s how we communicate best. We are simply wired to remember stories better than lists of facts, and this insight can be instrumental in the realm of data communication10. Jerome Bruner, a cognitive psychologist, posited that narratives up to 22 times more memorable than facts alone (Bruner, 1991). This underscores the importance of incorporating story elements not just into reports and presentations, but to weave it into your data visualizations as well.\nThe reason storytelling is so effective lies in its structure. Most narratives have a beginning, middle, and end, allowing the audience to follow along a ‘path’ which organically leads to the key message or conclusion.\nPresentations tend to start with a ‘where we were’, to a ‘what we did’ to a ‘what’s next’ section. Scientific articles tend start with an introduction, move to materials and methods, into a discussion and conclusion, and then suggest further research. Your tables and data visualizations tend to have an informative title on the top left, and progress to the smaller details in captions on the bottom right (in reading order across a page).\nThis temporal progression helps the audience to grasp the urgency and also the possible ramifications, allowing the data to be contextualized and thus, better remembered.\n\n\nChoose Your Own Adventure: The Role of Interactivity\nInteractivity is another dimension that can elevate your data communication strategies. Interactivity enables the viewer to explore the data by themselves, enhancing their understanding and retention of the information presented. A study by Yi, et al. demonstrated that interactivity significantly improved viewers’ ability to acquire insights from visualizations 11.\nIn today’s digital age, the opportunity for making data visualizations interactive is more accessible than ever, through tools and platforms that allow zooming, filtering, or even real-time updates. For example, instead of just showing a static map of volunteer and donation rates for your non-rofit, an interactive map could allow users to zoom into their local area or filter by various demographic factors. This not only keeps the viewer’s attention but also makes the information more relevant to them.\nMoreover, interactivity can serve to guide the viewer through complex datasets, in a manner somewhat akin to an interactive narrative. By allowing viewers to ‘unearth’ facts and trends themselves, you engage them in a form of ‘active learning,’ which is shown to be more effective for retention and understanding 12.\nBoth narrative storytelling and interactive elements can captivate the viewer’s attention, which is an increasingly scarce commodity in our information-saturated world. Used judiciously, these techniques can turn a dull report into a compelling story, and a static chart into an exploration, ensuring that your important data isn’t just seen, but also understood and remembered."

    "text": "Conclusions\nEffective data visualization is not merely a matter of aesthetics. It is a multifaceted discipline deeply rooted in cognitive science, psychology, and ethical considerations. The true beauty of a “pretty” data visualization lies in its ability to efficiently communicate complex information, provide context, evoke the right emotions, narrate a compelling story, and engage the audience interactively—all of which is backed by rigorous scholarly research. The aim is not just to make data visually appealing, but to transform it into a strategic asset for decision-making.\nSo, the next time you look at a data visualization and think it’s ‘pretty,’ ask yourself why. Is it just visually appealing, or does is the sum of it somehow greater than all of its parts? Chances are, if it’s genuinely effective, it’s much more than just a pretty picture."

In the meantime, I’ll be here.\n\n\nBonus notes\n\nThe conferences are styled Posit::conf(2023) because its a jokey nod to the way we write code in the R language, and nerds are nothing if not excited to make corny jokes whenever possible. (Not just limited to R, go ask the python folks why the name of their language is python.)\nIf you want to be social with me (these are by no means my “professional” socials, but I have fun anyway), I’m active on Instagram and on Threads.\n  - @laura_brianna"

    "text": "Harder to Read, Easier (?) to Remember\nHere’s where things get interesting. While ease of reading is undeniably important, some research suggests a paradoxical benefit to introducing a slight degree of difficulty into the reading process. This is referred to as the “disfluency effect”.\nI’m just going to let Kühl and Eitel summarize the concept of disfluency:\n\nthe concept of disfluency refers to the metacognitive experience of ease or difficulty associated with completing a mental task. If task completion is perceived as easy or fluent, one often uses heuristics and intuitions to process information. If task completion is perceived as difficult or disfluent, by contrast, one is more likely to engage in effortful and analytic processing\n\nThe ELI54 version of this is if you think something is “too easy”, you won’t care about it as much, think its “less important”, and not spend any effort moving it from short term memory to long term memory. But if you think something is just a little bit difficult, you’ll work a little bit harder to get it into your brain and work to fully understand it.\nThe disfluency effect posits that when something requires a little bit more effort to decode, it can lead to better memory and recall. Basically, if your audience is already at least partly bought-in to what you’re presenting, it might be worthwhile to (counterintuitively) actually make it harder for them to read.\nThere is also disfluency as measured by pauses like ums and uhs in in a speech stream. Obviously, these are related to spoken word, not written word, and have a different implication that this short (ish) blog post is focusing on, but there is increasing research in the utility of these spoken disfluencies in memory and recall5. And the emerging evidence is intriguing. (I’ll try to cover this in a future post.)\nSo if something seems “too easy” when you read it, you may read it too fast, skip over salient information, and not remember it later. But if something is “too hard” to read, you may give up entirely or not understand it fully. But the arena of disfluency in typeface or font choice being an improvement over something easier to read is still a bit muddy."

Adobe is investing a lot of research into fonts and typefaces and comprehension. It’s a less-common instance of Corporate Research being made widely available and making the world just a little bit better! Because they’re sharing their work, I’m going to just give a basic summary and link you below. I highly recommend going to read their blog posts (which all link to the published research summarized within).\n“The need to personalize fonts for each individual reader” is a great blog post summarizing some Adobe research that shows that there is no “best” font for everyone. They picked several pretty readable fonts (no fancy brush scripts here) and had people select their preference. And while people read their fastest font 35% faster than their slowest font, that wasn’t always their “favorite” font, and fast reading vs slow reading didn’t seem to matter (90% comprehension on multiple-choice questions across all fonts).6 7\nIf you’re interested in this kind of research, I also highly recommend The Readability Consortium, which is a partnership between Adobe, Google, UCF, and the NGO Readability Matters, which does a lot of research and outreach into, well, what it says on the tin: Readability.8"

    "section": "Cognitive Load & the Demand of Data",
    "text": "Cognitive Load & the Demand of Data\nUnderstanding data is an effortful process. The brain needs to interpret, compare, and derive meaning from what might be a deluge of numbers. Every data point, every number, every percentage demands cognitive resources for interpretation. This is the foundational premise of Cognitive Load Theory, established by Jonathan Sweller first in 19881. According to this theory, our working memory – the mental space where we process information – has a limited capacity. Overburdening it can lead to ineffective processing or even complete misunderstandings.\nCognitive Load Theory is broken into three primary types:\n\nIntrinsic Load: This is inherent to the material being learned. For example, basic arithmetic has a lower intrinsic load than advanced calculus. It’s the “base difficulty” of a subject, so to speak. You really can’t change this.\nExtraneous Load: This load doesn’t come from the material itself, but from how it’s presented. Think of a poorly designed infographic that confuses more than it clarifies, or a lecture that’s disorganized. This load is essentially “noise” – unnecessary cognitive effort that doesn’t help in understanding the core material.\nGermane Load: This is the cognitive effort directed towards constructing and automating schemas. Schemas are mental structures we use to organize and store information. When learning conditions are optimal, learners can effectively create these schemas, aiding long-term retention and understanding.\n\nWhen we’re faced with raw data, especially extensive analyses without any guiding structure, it’s analogous to being handed numerous jigsaw puzzle pieces, each from different puzzles. The cognitive effort required to even begin making sense of these pieces, let alone fitting them together into a coherent picture, is immense.\nWithout some form of categorization, summarization, or guiding narrative, we’re left to grapple with these disparate pieces, each vying for our limited cognitive attention. The challenge here isn’t simply about managing the volume of data, but about the very nature of how humans process information."

    "section": "The Necessity of Narrative",
    "text": "The Necessity of Narrative\nCognitively, humans are hardwired to understand and remember stories. This inclination traces back to our evolutionary history. Early humans, sitting around campfires, shared tales of hunting escapades, encounters with other tribes, or the mysteries of the stars. These stories weren’t just for entertainment; they were critical for survival. They served to transmit knowledge, culture, and values from one generation to the next.\n\n Narrative as Structure\nFrom a cognitive science perspective, stories help in organizing and making sense of information in a structured manner. When information is structured, it becomes more digestible, memorable, and impactful. Consider the difference between reading a dry list of facts versus engaging with a compelling narrative that weaves those facts into a coherent and emotionally resonant tale.\n\n\n Narrative as Context\nComplex ideas often require a rich tapestry of background knowledge to fully understand. Narratives are instrumental in providing this context. By embedding details within a story, the audience can understand the why, how, and what of a situation, rather than just the isolated facts.\n\n\n Narrative as Access\nA well-crafted narrative has multiple layers and can be approached from different angles, making it accessible to a diverse audience. Whether a listener is captivated by the human element, the overarching plot, or the intricate details, there’s something in the story for everyone. This inclusivity is essential when communicating complex ideas to audiences with varied backgrounds and interests.\nFurthermore, rather than being passive recipients of information, narratives encourage the audience to engage actively. As listeners or readers, we predict outcomes, empathize, and draw conclusions. This active participation aids in comprehension and retention.\n\n\n Narrative and Memory\nAt the heart of a good story is a central message or theme. While the surrounding details provide depth and richness, they all serve to support and amplify this core idea. This structure is incredibly useful when dealing with multifaceted subjects. By framing the complex idea within a narrative structure, the communicator can emphasize the most crucial aspects without getting lost in the minutiae.\nAdditionally, emotions are powerful drivers of memory. Studies have shown that emotionally charged events are remembered better than neutral events. Narratives, by their very nature, have an emotional component – they involve characters with desires, challenges, triumphs, and failures. When an audience is emotionally invested, they’re more likely to remember - and act on - the core message.2,3\n\n\n You (& Your C-Suite) as Characters in the Story\nYes, your presentation or document has characters. You as an analyst are a character in the story of the analysis. So are your users or customers, and so are the decision-makers you’re talking to. You could even consider your data a character. What else is the Introduction-Materials-Methods-Results-Discussion-Conclusion format of a scientific article if not the same as a Joseph Campbell arc of narrative?4 As humans, we (usually) want all of these groups to come out victorious in the end.\nNarrative isn’t merely a luxury or an add-on; it’s foundational to how we, as humans, understand and make sense of the world around us."

    "section": "A Picture is Worth A Thousand Words",
    "text": "A Picture is Worth A Thousand Words\nThere’s a reason the adage “a picture is worth a thousand words” has stood the test of time. Humans are visual creatures.\nOur capacity to quickly process and derive meaning from visual stimuli is unparalleled. Richard K. Lowe’s research underscores this point, suggesting that visual representations can significantly enhance understanding, especially when dealing with complex information5.\nThis isn’t just about slapping on a chart or a graph to a dataset. Effective visualization is an art and science in itself, one that understands and leverages human visual cognition. It’s about choosing the right kind of visualization based on the nature of the data, the relationships within it, and the key message one wants to convey. It’s about color choices, scale, hierarchy, and design – each playing a role in ensuring the data is not just seen, but truly understood. In a world increasingly dominated by data, the ability to convert that data into insightful visuals is not just beneficial; it’s imperative.\nBut why is it that visuals are so effective for our brains?\n\nProcessing Visual Stimuli\nThe human brain processes images in a fraction of a second, much faster than it takes to read a sentence. This rapid processing is courtesy of the visual cortex, a large section of our brain dedicated to interpreting visual information6. When we view a chart or a graph, multiple areas of the brain are activated, including those responsible for processing color, shape, and spatial relationships. Visual representations consolidate complex information into digestible chunks and patterns, and encodes information in multiple ways to even out work the brain does to ingest new information. This multi-faceted processing enables us to quickly grasp complex patterns and relationships that might take paragraphs to describe in words.\nThis means decision-makers can focus on analysis and interpretation rather than getting bogged down simply comprehending what is being shown in the visual.\n\n\nAvoiding Misrepresentation\nHowever, it’s important to acknowledge the limitations and potential pitfalls of visual data representation. Not all visualizations are created equal. A poorly designed graph might not only fail to communicate its message but can also mislead. Distorted axes, inappropriate color schemes, or simply trying to cram too much information into one visual can lead to confusion or misinterpretation.\nMisrepresented data can lead to incorrect policy decisions, mis-allocated resources, or misguided public perceptions. This underscores the importance of grounding data visualization practices in a solid understanding of both the data and the human cognitive processes at play.\nThus, the skills of a seasoned data scientist and an understanding of visual cognition are paramount to ensure that visuals serve their intended purpose: to illuminate, not obfuscate.\nWhile the visual representation of data is a powerful tool in the arsenal of decision-makers and communicators, it must be wielded with care, understanding, and expertise. As we move forward into an era saturated with data, the intersection of cognitive science and data visualization will be paramount in ensuring that we extract genuine insights and make informed decisions."

    "text": "The Ethical Imperative of Curated Presentation\nBeyond the cognitive and communicative challenges posed by raw data, there’s an overarching ethical dimension to consider. To claim that “data speaks for itself” is, in many ways, an abdication of responsibility.\nThis isn’t about distorting data or infusing it with bias. It’s about recognizing that data can be misinterpreted, misunderstood, or even manipulated. By curating its presentation, by providing the necessary context, narrative, and visualization, we’re ensuring its integrity. We’re ensuring that the decisions made on the back of this data are informed, accurate, and ethical.\nBut how does one curate data effectively without falling into the trap of over-simplification or bias? This is where interdisciplinary knowledge proves invaluable. A grounding in cognitive science aids in the clear communication of complex points. Foundations in neural sciences guide with the understanding of how different visual stimuli are processed.7 A deep understanding of the domain ensures that the essence of the data is maintained.\nSuch a fusion of knowledge bridges the gap between raw data and truthful, actionable insights.\nStill, there are challenges. As Davenport and Patil highlighted in their seminal 2012 Harvard Business Review article on the rise of the data scientist, the nexus of expertise required for effective data communication is rare.8 Not everyone has the luxury of extensive training in both domain expertise and cognitive processing. Thus, collaboration becomes key. Teams with varied expertise can come together to ensure data is not just accurate but also ethically and effectively presented.9"

    "text": "Concluding Thoughts\nThe belief that data can speak for itself is a seductive one. It offers a veneer of objectivity, suggesting that data is immune to the vagaries of human interpretation. Pure data, devoid of context and narrative, can be silent or even distort the truth.\nBut also, one shouldn’t have story just for the sake of story. After all, anecdotes are not evidence.\nThink of data as the raw material, and storytelling as the craft – turning that material into something tangible, relatable, and actionable. As experts in data interpretation and communication, we are not just number-crunchers but storytellers. We breathe life into numbers, ensuring that the message they carry isn’t just heard but deeply understood and felt.\nIn our mission to communicate data-derived insights, it’s crucial to remember the cognitive science behind information processing and the power of a well-told tale. By weaving our data within the fabric of a compelling story, using potent visualization techniques, and maintaining unwavering ethical standards, we ensure that our data doesn’t merely convey facts. Instead, it builds insights that can captivate, inspire, and most importantly, catalyze real-world action. When data and story work together, we can ensure that our data doesn’t just speak – it sinks in, it resonates, and most importantly, drives action."

    "text": "About the Author\nTechnically an Epidemiologist, Dr. Gast has spent her career at the intersection of communicating technical work to non-technical (and often extremely busy) decision makers.\nShe spent several years working primarily in Southern Africa developing malaria elimination strategies and operational reporting frameworks. It was during these years where she honed her skills for communicating something highly specific and technical in as little of time as humanly possible; sometimes you only have one data viz, one slide or one sentence to convince a powerful decision-maker that your idea is worth investing in. Dr. Gast has worked on infectious and communicable disease projects in at least 10 countries.\nBack in her didactic education days, she somehow managed to convince NASA to fund her Public Health doctoral dissertation. She spent several years wandering the jungles of Peru in order to figure out ways to use satellite imagery and machine learning to classify land-use land-cover changes and how it relates to mosquito-borne diseases like dengue hemorrhagic fever. Despite sleeping in a house without real doors where 3 people got dengue (and it was a 50/50 shot of waking up with 2 inches of water across the entire homestead and a mouse trying to climb the dresser to get away from the flood), she managed to complete her field work without getting dengue herself.\nThese days, you will find Laura living a calmer life, working for a non-profit dedicated to serving US military members and their families, wrestling with development and impact data.\nIn her ever-shrinking free time, Laura enjoys playing pub trivia, throwing some darts, attending live performances (comedy, rock, symphony, etc), or going on a nice long run on the US Mall."
