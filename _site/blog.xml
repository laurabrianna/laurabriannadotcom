<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="story-without-facts-facts-without-story">Story without Facts &amp; Facts without Story</h2>
<p>In some circles, the “storytelling” part of “data storytelling” automatically means you’re trying to pull the wool over the eyes of your audience.</p>
<p>I see this pushback from people all over the place. And for a reasonably good reason. You hear <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/b2538e04-87f5-4af5-bd6f-f6cf88b488c4">story</a> after <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38190720/blind-side-subject-michael-oher-alleges-adoption-was-lie-family-took-all-film-proceeds">story</a> in the popular press about how a storyteller has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-trial-going-infinite-number-go-up/">stretched</a> the truth to the point of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/15/usa.world">breaking</a>, all in service of a good “story”. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me dozens of times, you can’t out-story-tell the storyteller. My own father seems to rankle a bit when I talk about building a narrative of a presentation I’ve been asked to deliver.</p>
<p>As the tried (and tired?) and true trope goes, “anecdotes are not evidence”.</p>

<p>But the extreme other side of this issue is the “The Data Speaks for Itself” camp. How many times have we seen brilliant and nuanced scientific research be ignored because one (or both) extreme side hired the better storytellers? The tobacco lobby, Swift-Kelce conspiracy theories, literally every single ‘health food’ trend…</p>
<p>The data can speak for itself when the data collects itself and cleans itself. Until then we as data scientists, analysts, engineers and architects have to speak on behalf of the data.</p>
<p>And to speak on behalf of the data, we have to give it a fighting chance of being listened to, understood, and remembered - we have to tell its story.</p>

<section id="cognitive-load-the-demand-of-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cognitive-load-the-demand-of-data">Cognitive Load &amp; the Demand of Data</h2>
<p>Understanding data is an effortful process. The brain needs to interpret, compare, and derive meaning from what might be a deluge of numbers. Every data point, every number, every percentage demands cognitive resources for interpretation. This is the foundational premise of Cognitive Load Theory, established by Jonathan Sweller first in 1988<sup>1</sup>. According to this theory, our working memory – the mental space where we process information – has a limited capacity. Overburdening it can lead to ineffective processing or even complete misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Cognitive Load Theory is broken into three primary types:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Intrinsic Load</strong>: This is inherent to the material being learned. For example, basic arithmetic has a lower intrinsic load than advanced calculus. It’s the “base difficulty” of a subject, so to speak. You really can’t change this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extraneous Load</strong>: This load doesn’t come from the material itself, but from how it’s presented. Think of a poorly designed infographic that confuses more than it clarifies, or a lecture that’s disorganized. This load is essentially “noise” – unnecessary cognitive effort that doesn’t help in understanding the core material.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Germane Load</strong>: This is the cognitive effort directed towards constructing and automating schemas. Schemas are mental structures we use to organize and store information. When learning conditions are optimal, learners can effectively create these schemas, aiding long-term retention and understanding.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When we’re faced with raw data, especially extensive analyses without any guiding structure, it’s analogous to being handed numerous jigsaw puzzle pieces, each from different puzzles. The cognitive effort required to even begin making sense of these pieces, let alone fitting them together into a coherent picture, is immense.</p>
<p>Without some form of categorization, summarization, or guiding narrative, we’re left to grapple with these disparate pieces, each vying for our limited cognitive attention. The challenge here isn’t simply about managing the volume of data, but about the very nature of how humans process information.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-necessity-of-narrative" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-necessity-of-narrative">The Necessity of Narrative</h2>
<p>Cognitively, humans are hardwired to understand and remember stories. This inclination traces back to our evolutionary history. Early humans, sitting around campfires, shared tales of hunting escapades, encounters with other tribes, or the mysteries of the stars. These stories weren’t just for entertainment; they were critical for survival. They served to transmit knowledge, culture, and values from one generation to the next.</p>
<section id="fa-garage-narrative-as-structure" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fa-garage-narrative-as-structure"><i class="fa-solid fa-garage" aria-label="garage"></i> Narrative as Structure</h4>
<p>From a cognitive science perspective, stories help in organizing and making sense of information in a structured manner. When information is structured, it becomes more digestible, memorable, and impactful. Consider the difference between reading a dry list of facts versus engaging with a compelling narrative that weaves those facts into a coherent and emotionally resonant tale.</p>
</section>
<section id="fa-link-narrative-as-context" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fa-link-narrative-as-context"><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-label="link"></i> Narrative as Context</h4>
<p>Complex ideas often require a rich tapestry of background knowledge to fully understand. Narratives are instrumental in providing this context. By embedding details within a story, the audience can understand the <em>why</em>, <em>how</em>, and <em>what</em> of a situation, rather than just the isolated facts.</p>
</section>
<section id="fa-bridge-suspension-narrative-as-access" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fa-bridge-suspension-narrative-as-access"><i class="fa-solid fa-bridge-suspension" aria-label="bridge-suspension"></i> Narrative as Access</h4>
<p>A well-crafted narrative has multiple layers and can be approached from different angles, making it accessible to a diverse audience. Whether a listener is captivated by the human element, the overarching plot, or the intricate details, there’s something in the story for everyone. This inclusivity is essential when communicating complex ideas to audiences with varied backgrounds and interests.</p>
<p>Furthermore, rather than being passive recipients of information, narratives encourage the audience to engage actively. As listeners or readers, we predict outcomes, empathize, and draw conclusions. This active participation aids in comprehension and retention.</p>
</section>
<section id="fa-brain-narrative-and-memory" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fa-brain-narrative-and-memory"><i class="fa-solid fa-brain" aria-label="brain"></i> Narrative and Memory</h4>
<p>At the heart of a good story is a central message or theme. While the surrounding details provide depth and richness, they all serve to support and amplify this core idea. This structure is incredibly useful when dealing with multifaceted subjects. By framing the complex idea within a narrative structure, the communicator can emphasize the most crucial aspects without getting lost in the minutiae.</p>
<p>Additionally, emotions are powerful drivers of memory. Studies have shown that emotionally charged events are remembered better than neutral events. Narratives, by their very nature, have an emotional component – they involve characters with desires, challenges, triumphs, and failures. When an audience is emotionally invested, they’re more likely to remember - and act on - the core message.<sup>2</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>3</sup></p>

<section id="fa-person-running-fast-you-your-c-suite-as-characters-in-the-story" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fa-person-running-fast-you-your-c-suite-as-characters-in-the-story"><i class="fa-solid fa-person-running-fast" aria-label="person-running-fast"></i> You (&amp; Your C-Suite) as Characters in the Story</h4>
<p>Yes, your presentation or document has characters. You as an analyst are a character in the story of the analysis. So are your users or customers, and so are the decision-makers you’re talking to. You could even consider your data a character. What else is the Introduction-Materials-Methods-Results-Discussion-Conclusion format of a scientific article if not the same as a Joseph Campbell arc of narrative?<sup>4</sup> As humans, we (usually) want all of these groups to come out victorious in the end.</p>
<p>Narrative isn’t merely a luxury or an add-on; it’s foundational to how we, as humans, understand and make sense of the world around us.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words">A Picture is Worth A Thousand Words</h2>
<p>There’s a reason the adage “a picture is worth a thousand words” has stood the test of time. Humans are visual creatures.</p>
<p>Our capacity to quickly process and derive meaning from visual stimuli is unparalleled. Richard K. Lowe’s research underscores this point, suggesting that visual representations can significantly enhance understanding, especially when dealing with complex information<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about slapping on a chart or a graph to a dataset. Effective visualization is an art and science in itself, one that understands and leverages human visual cognition. It’s about choosing the right kind of visualization based on the nature of the data, the relationships within it, and the key message one wants to convey. It’s about color choices, scale, hierarchy, and design – each playing a role in ensuring the data is not just seen, but truly understood. In a world increasingly dominated by data, the ability to convert that data into insightful visuals is not just beneficial; it’s imperative.</p>
<p>But why is it that visuals are so effective for our brains?</p>
<section id="processing-visual-stimuli" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="processing-visual-stimuli">Processing Visual Stimuli</h4>
<p>The human brain processes images in a fraction of a second, much faster than it takes to read a sentence. This rapid processing is courtesy of the visual cortex, a large section of our brain dedicated to interpreting visual information<sup>6</sup>. When we view a chart or a graph, multiple areas of the brain are activated, including those responsible for processing color, shape, and spatial relationships. Visual representations consolidate complex information into digestible chunks and patterns, and encodes information in multiple ways to even out work the brain does to ingest new information. This multi-faceted processing enables us to quickly grasp complex patterns and relationships that might take paragraphs to describe in words.</p>
<p>This means decision-makers can focus on analysis and interpretation rather than getting bogged down simply comprehending what is being shown in the visual.</p>
</section>
<section id="avoiding-misrepresentation" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="avoiding-misrepresentation">Avoiding Misrepresentation</h4>
<p>However, it’s important to acknowledge the limitations and potential pitfalls of visual data representation. Not all visualizations are created equal. A poorly designed graph might not only fail to communicate its message but can also mislead. Distorted axes, inappropriate color schemes, or simply trying to cram too much information into one visual can lead to confusion or misinterpretation.</p>
<p>Misrepresented data can lead to incorrect policy decisions, mis-allocated resources, or misguided public perceptions. This underscores the importance of grounding data visualization practices in a solid understanding of both the data and the human cognitive processes at play.</p>
<p>Thus, the skills of a seasoned data scientist and an understanding of visual cognition are paramount to ensure that visuals serve their intended purpose: to illuminate, not obfuscate.</p>
<p>While the visual representation of data is a powerful tool in the arsenal of decision-makers and communicators, it must be wielded with care, understanding, and expertise. As we move forward into an era saturated with data, the intersection of cognitive science and data visualization will be paramount in ensuring that we extract genuine insights and make informed decisions.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="the-ethical-imperative-of-curated-presentation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ethical-imperative-of-curated-presentation">The Ethical Imperative of Curated Presentation</h2>
<p>Beyond the cognitive and communicative challenges posed by raw data, there’s an overarching ethical dimension to consider. To claim that “data speaks for itself” is, in many ways, an abdication of responsibility.</p>
<p>This isn’t about distorting data or infusing it with bias. It’s about recognizing that data can be misinterpreted, misunderstood, or even manipulated. By curating its presentation, by providing the necessary context, narrative, and visualization, we’re ensuring its integrity. We’re ensuring that the decisions made on the back of this data are informed, accurate, and ethical.</p>
<p>But how does one curate data effectively without falling into the trap of over-simplification or bias? This is where interdisciplinary knowledge proves invaluable. A grounding in cognitive science aids in the clear communication of complex points. Foundations in neural sciences guide with the understanding of how different visual stimuli are processed.<sup>7</sup> A deep understanding of the domain ensures that the essence of the data is maintained.</p>
<p>Such a fusion of knowledge bridges the gap between raw data and truthful, actionable insights.</p>
<p>Still, there are challenges. As Davenport and Patil highlighted in their seminal article on the rise of the data scientist, the nexus of expertise required for effective data communication is rare.<sup>8</sup> Not everyone has the luxury of extensive training in both domain expertise and cognitive processing. Thus, collaboration becomes key. Teams with varied expertise can come together to ensure data is not just accurate but also ethically and effectively presented.<sup>9</sup></p>
</section>
<section id="concluding-thoughts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
<p>The belief that data can speak for itself is a seductive one. It offers a veneer of objectivity, suggesting that data is immune to the vagaries of human interpretation. Pure data, devoid of context and narrative, can be silent or even distort the truth.</p>
<p>But also, one shouldn’t have story just for the sake of story. After all, anecdotes are not evidence.</p>
<p>Think of data as the raw material, and storytelling as the craft – turning that material into something tangible, relatable, and actionable. As experts in data interpretation and communication, we are not just number-crunchers but storytellers. We breathe life into numbers, ensuring that the message they carry isn’t just heard but deeply understood and felt.</p>
<p>In our mission to communicate data-derived insights, it’s crucial to remember the cognitive science behind information processing and the power of a well-told tale. By weaving our data within the fabric of a compelling story, using potent visualization techniques, and maintaining unwavering ethical standards, we ensure that our data doesn’t merely convey facts. Instead, it builds insights that can captivate, inspire, and most importantly, catalyze real-world action. When data and story work together, we can ensure that our data doesn’t just speak – it sinks in, it resonates, and most importantly, drives action.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pretty-means-more-than-just-pretty">‘Pretty’ Means More than Just ‘Pretty’</h2>
<p>In a data-driven world, the ability to effectively communicate complex information is invaluable. Sure, “data is the new oil” <sup>1</sup> - both data and raw petroleum need a lot of refinement to be made useful and profitable. But unlike oil, data requires more than mere processing; It requires context, analysis, and interpretation. This is where design comes in to play.</p>
<p>A “pretty” data visualization or “clean” looking text block or table may be more than visually appealing. Information design is not merely an art; it’s a science grounded in cognitive psychology, attention theory, and decision-making research.</p>

<p>The concept of cognitive load theory, first popularized by John Sweller in the late 1980s, serves as a critical framework for understanding how human cognition works during learning processes <sup>2</sup>. In its most simplified form, cognitive load theory posits that human working memory is limited, and that effective learning and decision-making are constrained by the amount of information we can process simultaneously. This is why its so hard to cram for an exam - you can only absorb so much at one time.</p>

<p>Cognitive load theory is broken apart into three components <sup>3</sup>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Intrinsic Cognitive Load: this is the inherent complexity associated with the material being learned or presented, and is related to the subject matter itself. The intrinsic load of a specific topic is generally unchangeable - it is easier to learn addition than it is to learn how to calculate differential equations.</p></li>
<li><p>Extraneous Cognitive Load: this is the additional cognitive load imposed by the way information is structured, presented, or the learning environment itself. It represents the unnecessary mental effort required to process information that is not directly relevant to the subject matter. While most people think of this as data visualization, it can also be the structure of a report, the scaffolding of a table, or the readability of a font selection. Your job as a presenter or teacher is to lessen the extraneous load as much as possible so you can maximize the impact of other two load types.</p></li>
<li><p>Germane Cognitive Load: This is the mental effort applied to learning the task itself, or the specific brain power used to organize information in the head, anchor it to existing and relevant existing schema, or create new schema and mental models. This is where a concept is integrated into long-term memory and made available for recall later.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In data visualization and information design, this principle is critical: overload your audience with too much information, complex visual structures, or intricate details, and you risk diluting the message you aim to convey. For instance, a visualization filled with unnecessary decorations, often called “chartjunk,” can increase extraneous cognitive load, and may lead to a less effective presentation of data <sup>4</sup>. This is the classic ‘Edward Tufte’ view of data visualization that you tend to hear in many data visualization courses <sup>5</sup>. You may also have heard about this as an ‘information to ink’ ratio, or something similar.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an overly simplistic visualization might not adequately represent the complexities of the data, thus under-utilizing the available cognitive resources and possibly leading to overly simplistic conclusions. You also may be accused of ‘hiding important information’ and lose some of your audience’s trust.</p>

<p>If that weren’t complicated enough, enter: The Infographic. Infographics tend to lean harder into the art side and/or journalism side of things.</p>
<p>On the journalism side, you have probably seen some gorgeous visualizations from brilliant and creative people like <a href="https://www.albertocairo.com">Alberto Cairo</a> or <a href="https://monachalabi.com">Mona Chalabi</a>.

<p>These visuals don’t 100% firmly obey the “Classic Tufte Method”. But also no one can say these visuals do not draw you in, teach you something, and leave you with something interesting to chew on for a while. They are incredibly effective. If you look hard enough, the core ideas are rooted firmly in the foundations; the cleverest people know exactly how to break which rules and when.</p>

<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-8">
<p>Effective visualizations strike a balance; they are rich enough to convey the necessary complexity of the data while being simple enough to be quickly and easily understood. If they incorporate artistic flourishes, those serve to draw you in and keep you there, and are put in with surgical precision to stay out of the way of the information itself.</p>
<p>The best communicators use several different encoding mechanisms - balancing extrinsic load across systems that process color, text, pattern, movement, and more - to deliver more information in a more digestible way. This sweet spot makes the most efficient use of our cognitive resources, ensuring that the message gets through clearly and memorably without unnecessary mental strain.</p>
<p>The concept of cognitive load serves as both a guide and a warning: it helps designers create more effective visualizations, but it’s also a reminder that optimizing for one audience might not work for another.</p>
<p>Which leads us to our next point.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-importance-of-context-emotion">The Importance of Context (&amp; Emotion)</h2>
<p>Back to the classic business context, data visualization is not just about displaying data points, but also about setting them within the right context.</p>
<section id="framing-effects-and-attention" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="framing-effects-and-attention">Framing Effects and Attention</h3>
<p>Context is crucial in data visualization because the way information is framed can dramatically influence how it is received and understood. Kahneman and Tversky’s seminal work on prospect theory reveals that the same information, when presented differently, can lead to divergent decisions and perceptions <sup>6</sup>. This cognitive bias, known as the framing effect, manifests itself in various domains, including public health, finance, and social policy.</p>
<p>Once you start looking, you see these framing effects are everywhere.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A new drug that can cure 70% of patients. Framing this information as “30% of patients will not be cured” could discourage its usage compared to saying “70% will be cured.”</p></li>
<li><p>A graph showcasing increasing CO2 levels over the last decade is likely to be ignored. However, if paired with a timeline of natural disasters in the same period, the same data could evoke a more urgent response.</p></li>
<li><p>Election maps are typically colored by area to show which candidate won which region, which doesn’t align at all with population density. There is a big difference in showing a geographic area versus showing a cartogram (where the size of each region is adjusted based on population).</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="emotional-impact-and-ethical-considerations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="emotional-impact-and-ethical-considerations">Emotional Impact and Ethical Considerations</h3>
<p>Emotion serves as another pivotal axis around which data visualization revolves. Emotion can both enhance and skew the interpretation of data. For example, vivid, fear-inducing colors in a heat map could elicit a stronger response compared to softer, less alarming colors. Simply making a number on a report bold and red will evoke a more emotional tone than the exact same number in black text. Color has a demonstrable impact on psychological functioning. Misleading color choices not only violate ethical standards but also can trigger unintended emotional responses <sup>7</sup>.</p>
<p>The use of emotion in data visualization raises several ethical considerations.</p>
<p>Emotion can be a powerful tool to break down barriers of apathy or desensitization. Think of the images and infographics that went viral during significant social movements or disasters. Their emotional resonance often led to higher engagement and subsequent action.</p>
<p>Emotionally charged visualizations must also consider the risk of reinforcing stereotypes or biases. An ill-designed graphic could inadvertently stigmatize communities, leading to adverse societal implications. Thus, ethical guidelines such as “fairness” and “do no harm,” which are cornerstones of responsible journalism and scientific reporting, extend their applicability to the domain of data visualization. Emphasizing the need for transparent scales, accurate data representation, and avoiding deceptive visual elements ensure the graph is both “pretty” and ethical.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>To navigate this intricate landscape, understanding the nuances of both framing and emotional elements can be instrumental. By doing so, one can leverage the power of visualization to inform and persuade, while maintaining ethical integrity.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="those-who-tell-the-stories-rule-the-world">Those Who Tell the Stories Rule the World</h2>
<section id="narrative-and-memory" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="narrative-and-memory">Narrative and Memory</h3>
<p>Humans are storytellers by default and have been for at least 30,000 years <sup>9</sup>. It’s how we communicate best. We are simply wired to remember stories better than lists of facts, and this insight can be instrumental in the realm of data communication<sup>10</sup>. Jerome Bruner, a cognitive psychologist, posited that narratives up to 22 times more memorable than facts alone (Bruner, 1991). This underscores the importance of incorporating story elements not just into reports and presentations, but to weave it into your data visualizations as well.</p>
<p>The reason storytelling is so effective lies in its structure. Most narratives have a beginning, middle, and end, allowing the audience to follow along a ‘path’ which organically leads to the key message or conclusion.</p>
<p>Presentations tend to start with a ‘where we were’, to a ‘what we did’ to a ‘what’s next’ section. Scientific articles tend start with an introduction, move to materials and methods, into a discussion and conclusion, and then suggest further research. Your tables and data visualizations tend to have an informative title on the top left, and progress to the smaller details in captions on the bottom right (in reading order across a page).</p>
<p>This temporal progression helps the audience to grasp the urgency and also the possible ramifications, allowing the data to be contextualized and thus, better remembered.</p>
</section>
<section id="choose-your-own-adventure-the-role-of-interactivity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="choose-your-own-adventure-the-role-of-interactivity">Choose Your Own Adventure: The Role of Interactivity</h3>
<p>Interactivity is another dimension that can elevate your data communication strategies. Interactivity enables the viewer to explore the data by themselves, enhancing their understanding and retention of the information presented. A study by Yi, et al.&nbsp;demonstrated that interactivity significantly improved viewers’ ability to acquire insights from visualizations <sup>11</sup>.</p>
<p>In today’s digital age, the opportunity for making data visualizations interactive is more accessible than ever, through tools and platforms that allow zooming, filtering, or even real-time updates. For example, instead of just showing a static map of volunteer and donation rates for your non-rofit, an interactive map could allow users to zoom into their local area or filter by various demographic factors. This not only keeps the viewer’s attention but also makes the information more relevant to them.</p>
<p>Moreover, interactivity can serve to guide the viewer through complex datasets, in a manner somewhat akin to an interactive narrative. By allowing viewers to ‘unearth’ facts and trends themselves, you engage them in a form of ‘active learning,’ which is shown to be more effective for retention and understanding <sup>12</sup>.</p>
<p>Both narrative storytelling and interactive elements can captivate the viewer’s attention, which is an increasingly scarce commodity in our information-saturated world. Used judiciously, these techniques can turn a dull report into a compelling story, and a static chart into an exploration, ensuring that your important data isn’t just seen, but also understood and remembered.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Effective data visualization is not merely a matter of aesthetics. It is a multifaceted discipline deeply rooted in cognitive science, psychology, and ethical considerations. The true beauty of a “pretty” data visualization lies in its ability to efficiently communicate complex information, provide context, evoke the right emotions, narrate a compelling story, and engage the audience interactively—all of which is backed by rigorous scholarly research. The aim is not just to make data visually appealing, but to transform it into a strategic asset for decision-making.</p>
<p>So, the next time you look at a data visualization and think it’s ‘pretty,’ ask yourself why. Is it just visually appealing, or does is the sum of it somehow greater than all of its parts? Chances are, if it’s genuinely effective, it’s much more than just a pretty picture.</p>

<li><p>Why <em>glitter</em>? It just gets everywhere. Demitri Martin said it best when he said that “glitter is the herpes of craft supplies”. I guess in some way maybe its a good analogy, because you want your message to stay with your audience for a long long time, but still.</p></li>
<li><p>I firmly believe that <strong>good design is absolutely critical to producing deliverables that people <em>want to</em> use, and <em>actually do</em> use</strong>. I know that this holds true for applications, powerpoint decks, and even basic Excel spreadsheets. I’ve spent the majority of my career so far orbiting around this concept.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So by the time the call came out to pitch talks for the 2023 conference, I had been stewing on this unfortunately named session title for at least 6 months. If only to save my sanity, I had to pitch something.<br>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="minutes-is-not-long-enough">20 Minutes is Not Long Enough</h2>
<p>Now Posit itself is equal parts data science, data engineering, and development. But being a very open community, there are also dozens of user groups who attend these conferences - from pharma and life sciences researchers, to business operations, to the insurance industry. It’s a uniquely and fantastically wide world of expertise at these things. So I did my best to identify a single train of thought that could be presented in the 20-minute window.</p>
<p>The Posit team liked it.</p>

<p>They invited me for a 20-minute talk. And that talk turned into <em>Why Design Is Worth The Time: Leveraging cognitive science to amplify impact.</em> As a compliment to the many conference sessions that gave great ways <em>how</em> to make deliverables beautiful and cohesive, I wanted to provide some scientific backing for <em>why</em> it is worth the time it takes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Shockingly, 20 minutes is not enough time to condense 15+ years of obsession with how the human brain processes information. I used my 20 minutes to hit the highlights of cognitive science in very superficial detail, provide my practical recommendations about based in that science, and then provide citations and links for people to dig in further.</p>
<p>Turns out lots of people liked it.<br>

<section id="the-problem-with-nerds" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem-with-nerds">The Problem with Nerds</h2>
<p>The problem with nerds is that when we hear something interesting that we can use to make our lives easier, we want more information about how we can use it.</p>
<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-7">
<p>I treat it as the utmost compliment that I had more than one person tell me they made some tweaks to their talks the day after mine using some of my tips. And I’ve had dozens of follow-up questions from people from chatting at the conference, or via email/LinkedIn.</p>
<p>So that brings us here: to a blog.</p>

<p>I plan on using this space as a place to expand on the topics of intersection of design, cognitive science in information processing, data storytelling, and information communication.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I’ll be presenting again at Posit::conf(2024), however Posit is notoriously good at big swings at inclusivity and rarely accept talks from the same person two years in a row. So at a minimum, you’ll see me as an attendee in Seattle in 2024. In the meantime, I’ll be here.</p>

Bonus notes
</h5>
<p>The conferences are styled Posit::conf(2023) because its a jokey nod to the way we write code in the R language, and nerds are nothing if not excited to make corny jokes whenever possible. (Not just limited to R, go ask the python folks why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#Design_philosophy_and_features" title="they just loved Monty Python (seriously)">the name of their language is python</a>.)</p>
<p>If you want to be social with me (these are by no means my “professional” socials, but I have fun anyway), I’m active on Instagram and on Threads.</p>
