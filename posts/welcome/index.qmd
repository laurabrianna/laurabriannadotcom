As I was developing my talk for Posit::conf(2023)
Articulation was coaching
Cohort suggested I needed to write a bunch of these topics up for more information

If you want to be social with me (these are by no means my "professinoal" socials, but I
have fun anyway), I'm active on Instagram and on Threads.
